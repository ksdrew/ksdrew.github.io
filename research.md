	<h3>Protein Complex Discovery</h3>
</p>
<p>
Protein complexes are physically associated proteins that carry out many of the cell's essential functions.  A fundamental question in biology is to understand how proteins organize themselves into these functional molecular machines.  I build computational methods which analyze and integrate large scale protein interaction data towards the aim of assemblying the set of all protein complexes.  These methods identify novel protein complexes as well as novel subunits of known complexes which allows us to ask additional question about how protein complexes arise through evolution as well as identify novel disease gene candidates and functions for unannotated genes.
