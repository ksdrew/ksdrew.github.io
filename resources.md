<h3>hu.MAP</h3>
<p>
Proteins interact with each other and organize themselves into macromolecular machines (ie. complexes) to carry out essential functions of the cell. We have a good understanding of a few complexes such as the proteasome and the ribosome but currently we have an incomplete view of all protein complexes as well as their functions. The hu.MAP attempts to address this lack of understanding by integrating several large scale protein interaction datasets to obtain the most comprehensive view of protein complexes. In <a href="https://humap3.proteincomplexes.org/h3" target="_blank">hu.MAP 3.0</a> we integrated large scale affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP/MS) datasets from Bioplex, Bioplex2.0, Bioplex3.0, Boldt et al. and Hein et al., large scale biochemical fractionation data (Wan et al.), proximity labeling data (Gupta et al., Youn et al.), and RNA hairpin pulldown data (Treiber et al.) to produce a complex map with over 15k complexes.
