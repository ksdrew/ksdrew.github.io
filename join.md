<strong>Visiting Research Specialist (Lab Tech)</strong>
<br>

The Drew Lab is accepting applications for a highly motivated and ambitious Visiting Research Specialist (Lab Tech) interested in studying macromolecular assemblies. The research in the Drew Lab has several ongoing projects focused on the identification, characterization, and modulation of assembly activity. Most projects aim to understand general principles of assemblies, but we also aim to better understand the role assemblies play in specific diseases such as ciliopathies. We do this using high throughput proteomics, machine learning, and molecular modeling. Further information about our current research can be found on our <a href="/research/">reseach page</a>.

In this role you will have the opportunity to: 
<ul>
<li>
Execute critical experiments with careful attention to detail, consistency, and documentation. 
</li>
<li>
Collaborate with other scientists to develop new experimental methods and test novel ideas.
</li>
<li>
Manage a growing lab doing cutting edge research.
</li>
<li>
Grow your knowledge base and learn about new approaches and techniques in High-Throughput Proteomics and Data Science
</li>
</ul>
