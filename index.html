The Drew Lab studies macromolecular assemblies in cells. These assemblies, made up of mostly proteins and nucleic acids, are responsible for most biological functions. We are specifically interested in learning how these assemblies function mechanistically and how they relate to human disease. We do this using biochemical, computational, and proteomic approaches. We aim to uncover the identities of assembly components, determine their 3D structure, and modulate their activity.
