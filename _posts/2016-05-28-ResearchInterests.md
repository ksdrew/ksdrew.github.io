title: Overview

My main research interests involve protein interactions and protein complexes, specifically understanding their structure, function and ways to modulate their activity.  To accomplish these goals I develop computational methods to analyze large scale proteomics data such as affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proteome-wide biochemical fractionation in order to discover new protein interactions and complexes.  Additionally, I develop methods to model three dimensional structure of interactions and complexes as well as design small molecule inhibitors to disrupt those interactions.
