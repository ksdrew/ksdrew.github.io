I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in the department of Biological Sciences. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Edward Marcotte's Lab](http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page) and [John Wallingford's Lab](https://www.wallingfordlab.org/) at UT Austin.  My main research interests involve protein interactions and protein complexes specifically understanding their structure, function and ways of modulating their activity.  

I received my PhD from New York University where I worked in the lab of [Richard Bonneau](http://bonneaulab.bio.nyu.edu/).  My thesis involved two components: 1) the Human Proteome Folding Project and 2) Peptidomimetic design.  The Human Proteome Folding Project ([HPF](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/proteome/overview.do) and [HPF2](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/hpf2/overview.do)) was a genome wide function annotation of 100 genomes using Rosetta protein structure predictions produced on [IBM's World Community Grid](http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/).  My work on peptidomimetic design was done in collaboration with the [Arora Lab](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/arora/) at NYU Chemistry and involved developing code with in the [Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/) software suite to design inhibitors of protein protein interactions.

Vedanti is a student at Daniel Wright Junior High School and Northwestern's Center for Talent Development. After winning Scholastic's "Hardest Math Problem Student Contest'', Vedanti's love of science and math eventually led her to discover that many intersectional fields exist, including computational biology.
Vedanti's current project in the Drew Lab is an investigation of the efficacy of a potential therapeutic for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Researchers have discovered a compound that inhibits viral protein mPro, a requirement for the viral life cycle. Vedanti is specifically investigating how likely this compound is to inhibit mPro in other viruses. In her spare time, she loves to teach competitive math through her non-profit organization.
